# Bookstore_Inventory_System
This is the design & implementation of a bookstore inventory management system (using Python).
The Bookstore Inventory System is a Python-based command-line application for managing a bookstore's inventory, customers, and orders. This system allows you to perform various tasks, including adding and updating books, managing customers, and tracking orders.

## Technology Stack:
- Python3.2
- pickle
- PrettyTable
- sqlite3

# Setup:
1. Install Python 3 or higher.
2. Install the following Python libraries:
    - pickle
    - PrettyTable
    - sqlite3
3. Create a file named `inventory.pkl` to store the inventory data.

# Requirements:
- Python 3 or higher
- pickle library
- PrettyTable library
- sqlite3 library

# Output:

When the user selects an option, the program performs the corresponding action. For example, if the user selects "Add a book to the inventory", the program prompts the user for the book's title, author, ISBN, price, and quantity. The program then adds the book to the inventory and displays a message confirming that the book has been added.
The program also provides various functions for managing the inventory, such as searching for books by title, editing books, and deleting books.
